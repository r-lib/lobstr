\title{Calculate the size of an object.}
\usage{
prim_size(..., env = parent.frame())

compare_size(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{Environment in which to terminate search. This defaults to the
current environment so that you don't include the size of objects that
are already stored elsewhere.}

\item{x, ...}{Set of objects to compute total size.}
}
\value{
An estimate of the size of the object, in bytes.
}
\description{
\code{prim_size} works similarly to \code{\link{object.size}}, but counts
more accurately and includes the size of environments. \code{compare_size}
makes it easy to compare the output of \code{prim_size} and
\code{object.size}.
}
\section{Environments}{


\code{prim_size} attempts to take into account the size of the
environments associated with an object. This is particularly important
for closures and formulas, since otherwise you may not realise that you've
accidentally captured a large object. However, it's easy to over count:
you don't want to include the size of every object in every environment
leading back to the \code{\link{emptyenv}()}. \code{prim_size} takes
a heuristic approach: it never counts the size of the global env,
the base env, the empty env or any namespace.

Additionally, the \code{env} argument allows you to specify another
environment at which to stop. This defaults to the environment from which
\code{prim_size} is called to prevent double-counting of objects created
elsewhere.

\examples{
# object.size doesn't keep track of shared elements in an object
# prim_size does
x <- 1:1e4
z <- list(x, x, x)
compare_size(z)

# this means that prim_size is not transitive
prim_size(x)
prim_size(z)
prim_size(x, z)

# object.size doesn't include the size of environments, which makes
# it easy to miss objects that are carrying around large environments
f <- function() {
  x <- 1:1e4
  a ~ b
}
compare_size(f())
}
